# Core Functionality Plugin

A plugin to keep the functionalities unrelated to theme-develop.

## Description

This plugin holds functionalities to improve your WordPress instalation and creates a custom post type for portfolio items. It creates a new interface to manage your portfolio posts separate from blog posts and web pages.
It also renames the WordPress dashboard **Posts** in to **Blog posts**.
This plugin was created to use mainly in small client sites based on the way I work and my personal needs as a developer.
